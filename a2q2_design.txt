Function 1: distance(name)

Inputs:
name: string, the name of the datafile to be opened

Outputs:
None, this function will print out the distances of each random walk

Pseudo-code:
Initialize last to 0 and steps as an empty list

Open the datafile with the name name and read the contents into a variable r

Split the contents of r into a list lines based on newline characters

Loop through each line in lines and split it into a list of steps and append the list to steps

Loop through each list of steps in steps
a. If the step is 'R', add 1 to last
b. If the step is 'L', subtract 1 from last

Print the absolute value of last

Reset last to 0 and repeat the loop for the next list of steps

Test Cases:
Test input: 'R L L R'
Test output: 0
Test input: 'L R R L R'
Test output: 1
Test input: 'R R R'
Test output: 3
